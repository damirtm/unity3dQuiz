## Q1: Usually sumB would be better because of lower count of operations, but might work bad on some processor architectures. sumA probably works better with processor cache, but I'm not sure.

I expect that sumA will have 4 times more loop jumps and comparisions.
I've verified it by exploring compiler output on x86-64 architecture (https://godbolt.org/g/9QzUGt). 
It easy to see that sumB requires 4 data registers to store sum accumulators so if processor does have less - there will be constant spilling/filling.
I would expect that sumA will work better with a processor cache - cache will be warmed up faster because of switching x and y variables against a common way of walking through a two dimentional array.
Hovewer I'm not sure about it and going to refresh my knowledge. :-) Just to mention, I'm not a C++ developer, never worked with it, so I don't know how exactly compiller works.
